Draka is the only champion that needs to attack.\r\n\r\nOther cards considered:\r\n[Blue Dragon](/card/blue_dragon), [Forcemage Apprentice](/card/forcemage_apprentice) - I think a bigger Sage section could be interesting, but I really want to be triggering [Fire Shaman](/card/fire_shaman) and Loyalty as much as I can. When [Inspiration](/card/inspiration) finally releases I think Sage will become a bigger component.\r\n\r\n[Rampaging Wurm](/card/rampaging_wurm) - This was in the deck pre-Tyrants, but it's too easy to block/remove in my opinion. [Draka, Dragon Tyrant](/card/draka__dragon_tyrant) replaced it due to airborne.\r\n\r\n[Wolf's Bite](/card/wolfs_bite) - I considered playing this instead of [Lightning Strike](/card/lightning_strike) for the recycle. It still might be worth it, but I think 5 damage will serve the deck better, if only to combine with AoE damage or kill my own [Soul Hunter](/card/soul_hunter).",

Then you have LL, MS, and CT which fetch back those cards to blow back up the field. Then DoB is an alt win condition should you blow up their stuff enough times. Mostly you will win via your unbreakable champions swinging in every turn, VL is huge here as he gets bigger for doing damage. whether its done to your opponent or their champion. The deck has a few weaknesses. First all of your damage dealers have little defense so burn decks will give you some issues. I thought about including Zombie Apocalypse and Amnesia for those fights but I prefer my reanimation package I have because I can use them to snag back MS or AoD instead. The other problem is a lack of drawing in this deck. Whether by normal draws or drawing effects like Crystal Golem. This deck though does have a pretty stable play though.

        "description_md": "The goal of this deck is to quickly build a massive army of human tokens, and then use other champions and events to buff the damage of the tokens to the point that they overwhelm the opponent's blockers and hit your opponent for lethal damage. In my first real game with this deck, I drew an extremely lucky \"God Hand\" which dealt a massive 138 damage to my opponent for a decisive Turn 1 victory.\r\n\r\nTo play this deck, try to play cards with powerful ally abilities ([Noble Unicorn](/card/noble_unicorn), [Lord of the Arena](/card/lord_of_the_arena), [The People's Champion](/card/the_people_s_champion)) early on. Use cards like [Markus, Watch Captain](/card/markus__watch_captain) and [Lord of the Arena](/card/lord_of_the_arena) to block your opponent's champions while you muster your army (Don't forget to play your \"summon X humans\" events *before* activating [Rabble Rouser](/card/rabble_rouser)), then go on the offensive when you have both [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul) and [Insurgency](/card/insurgency) in your hand. Play the [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul) on the end of your opponent's turn, then play [Insurgency](/card/insurgency) on your turn to make your army unbreakable, and swing for the win. If they manage to kill your [Rabble Rouser](/card/rabble_rouser) or [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul) before you are ready to attack, you can always resurrect them with an [Angel of Mercy](/card/angel_of_mercy). (However, it is advisable to hold [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul) in your hand until you are ready to attack, as playing it early signals your intentions to your opponent.)\r\n\r\nAs far as countering other decks goes, this deck has some pretty good answers. [Markus, Watch Captain](/card/markus__watch_captain) and [Noble Unicorn](/card/noble_unicorn) allow you to at least maintain your hand size against a discard-heavy Sage deck, and [Blind Faith](/card/blind_faith) lets you surprise fliers by swarming them with your tokens. [Inheritance of the Meek](/card/inheritance_of_the_meek) and [Quell](/card/quell) allow you to cull your opponent's big stompy champions without destroying your token army, and of course [Forced Exile](/card/forced_exile) gives you some nice single-target removal. Due to [The People's Champion](/card/the_people_s_champion) and espescially [Rabble Rouser](/card/rabble_rouser), this deck will even overwhelm demon, wolf, and even zombie based decks with sheer numbers.\r\nIf you ever get in trouble, you can almost always play a free \"Summon Human\" event to give you cheap blockers, though this is less effective against breakthrough.\r\n\r\nSo far, the best answers I've seen to this deck are [Wave of Transformation](/card/wave_of_transformation) (because your new wolf tokens don't receive the majority of the buffs), [Ceasefire](/card/ceasefire) (because you lose the tempo), and [Blind Faith](/card/blind_faith) (because your token army loses the *unbreakable* keyword from [Insurgency](/card/insurgency) an is now vulnerable to [Flash Fire](/card/flash_fire) and the like). Beyond that, once you play [Insurgency](/card/insurgency) there is very little your opponent can to stop you.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are curious as to how I dealt that much damage in a single round, I (because I went second) played three [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul) in ambush on my opponent's turn, and spent my gold on [Secret Legion](/card/secret_legion). On my turn, I drew [Paros, Rebel Leader](/card/paros__rebel_leader), which I played, followed by [Insurgency](/card/insurgency). This gave me a total of 12 *blitz*ed, *unbreakable* humans. When all of the [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul)s attacked, my humans were getting a total +8 Combat buff (+1 from [Paros, Rebel Leader](/card/paros__rebel_leader), +1 from [Insurgency](/card/insurgency), +2 from each of three [Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul)s) which gave me a total of (1+8)x12 + (2+8)x3 = 138 damage.",

        "description_md": "The goal of this deck is to win with massive damage, which will go right past most defenders. With proper use of [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) and [Surprise Attack](/card/surprise_attack), it is possible to play a dragon on each turn. \r\n\r\nThe card that really makes this deck work is [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald). This *amazing* card gives you the flexibility that you need to reliably win matches. It provides you with a quick answer to a token army ([Draka, Dragon Tyrant](/card/draka__dragon_tyrant)), it can expend your opponent's blockers ([Ice Drake](/card/ice_drake)), give you a quick 'zap' to deal with those really annoying 1-4 defense cards like [Thought Plucker](/card/thought_plucker), [Necromancer Lord](/card/necromancer_lord), [Dark Assassin](/card/dark_assassin), etc. by summoning [Blue Dragon](/card/blue_dragon) or [Strafing Dragon](/card/strafing_dragon), and of course, it can summon [Thundarus](/card/thundarus) before your dragons attack for a massive damage buff.\r\n\r\nTo play this deck effectively, save your [Surprise Attack](/card/surprise_attack) to play slow dragons like [Thundarus](/card/thundarus) and [Draka, Dragon Tyrant](/card/draka__dragon_tyrant) on your opponent's turn, and only when you absolutely have to. For the most part, you should play slow dragons on your turn, and fast dragons on your opponent's turn. Save [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) for emergencies (like scrying for a [Gold Dragon](/card/gold_dragon) when your health is low), and only [Surprise Attack](/card/surprise_attack) in a [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) as a last-ditch effort. Use [Lesson Learned](/card/lesson_learned) as needed to re-cast [Surprise Attack](/card/surprise_attack) or to [Vanishing](/card/vanishing) a [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald). Remember, the goal is to play a dragon every round, overwhelming your opponent with massive airborne damage.\r\n\r\nAn especially cheap but effective strategy is to play [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) followed immediately by [Vanishing](/card/vanishing) your [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) back into your hand, without ever allowing your opponent the opportunity to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThis deck is strong against token decks due to [Draka, Dragon Tyrant](/card/draka__dragon_tyrant)'s damage trigger, it can clear the board effectively with [Hurricane](/card/hurricane) (because with [Thundarus](/card/thundarus) all of your dragons except [Blue Dragon](/card/blue_dragon) will have 10 or more defense), and it can easily survive attrition due to [Gold Dragon](/card/gold_dragon)'s *righteous* buff, especially if [Thundarus](/card/thundarus) is in play.\r\n\r\nThis deck has one major weakness: board wipes. Before *Tyrants*, dragon decks were somewhat impractical because most dragons are slow, and therefore it took several turns to play [Thundarus](/card/thundarus) and the rest of your dragons, and then prepare them, and then attack with them. Once you did, a single [Apocalypse](/card/apocalypse) or the like could undo all your hard work, putting you right back to square one. Now, with more dragons to choose from and more flexibility from [Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald), 'flash' decks are much less of a threat, though full board wipes will still hurt. The best thing that you can do is to keep playing dragons, and you will eventually exhaust their supply of events. One tip that might be useful is to use [Strafing Dragon](/card/strafing_dragon) and [Blue Dragon](/card/blue_dragon) to deal damage to the opponent directly, instead of his creatures, aiming to win by attrition.",

        "description_md": "This deck isn't really intended for serious play, but just an idea that just occurred to me recently. The idea is to exploit [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort)'s ability to shield non-combat champions with very weak defense from 'zap' events. Most of these champions have really useful \"expend\" abilities, but they don't often see play because they'll die before you have a chance to really use them to full effect. However, an entire board of these champions, shielded by a [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort), might just stand a chance.\r\n\r\nEverything in this deck is designed to exploit the *untargetable* buff that [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort) gives your champions. Cards like [High King](/card/high_king), [Dark Assassin](/card/dark_assassin), and [Elara, the Lycomancer](/card/elara__the_lycomancer) are used to remove your opponent's champions, while [Necromancer Lord](/card/necromancer_lord), [Corpse Taker](/card/corpse_taker), [Resurrection](/card/resurrection), and to a lesser extent, [Angel of Mercy](/card/angel_of_mercy) are used to bring back cards like your [Necromancer Lord](/card/necromancer_lord) (and of course, his [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort)) so that he can resurrect the rest of your \"expend to do something awesome\" team in short order. [Drinker of Blood](/card/drinker_of_blood) will slowly drain your opponent's health, and [Muse](/card/muse) / [Thought Plucker](/card/thought_plucker) will keep you supplied with plenty of flexibility, while limiting your opponent's hand size. [Vampire Lord](/card/vampire_lord) and [Thrasher Demon](/card/thrasher_demon) will very quickly grow out of control when protected from 'zap' cards that would ordinarily kill them before they can reach their full potential. Finally, [Avenging Angel](/card/avenging_angel) will prevent your opponent from attacking you, rendering him all but helpless against your trench warfare. The 'ace-in-the-hole' that this deck uses is the [Guilt Demon](/card/guilt_demon) / [Army of the Apocalypse](/card/army_of_the_apocalypse) combo. The premise is that you slowly banish cards with recall and all champions out of your opponent's discard. Then, you play [Army of the Apocalypse](/card/army_of_the_apocalypse) to resurrect your entire team of necromancers, assassins, and of course, a [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort). Of course, because his champions are banished, your opponent will be left with an empty board.\r\n\r\nThis deck will obviously lose quickly to blitz or token decks, because it requires several turns to set up your champions properly. However, once you have reached your ideal board state, it will be almost impossible for your opponent to stop you. Your top priority is to keep a [Royal Escort](/card/royal_escort) out at all times, whether by saving your gold for [Resurrection](/card/resurrection), saving a [Necromancer Lord](/card/necromancer_lord) to return him to play, or using [Corpse Taker](/card/corpse_taker)'s tribute to pull him back to your hand.\r\n\r\nThe major weakness of this deck is full board wipes, like [Apocalypse](/card/apocalypse), because those cards don't target specific champions. The only way to counter this at the moment is to sit on a [Corpse Taker](/card/corpse_taker) or (better) an [Army of the Apocalypse](/card/army_of_the_apocalypse) to 'undo' the board wipe. However, if your opponent is not prepared with multiple board clearing cards, you will probably be fine.",

        "description_md": "## Hyper Tokens by Ben Sullivan (BenEBeats)\r\n\r\n###### Last update May 16, 2015\r\n\r\n##### I saw multiple tokens lists online that I thought had some promise, but were either not fast enough or were not powerful enough. This is my attempt at keeping the explosiveness of tokens while offering some resiliency. This version is 2.0 updated for the Tyrants expansion.\r\n\r\n \r\n#### The default strategy of the deck is to go too wide for our opponent and then play anthem effects to either kill our opponents in one attack or to take a huge chunk out of their life total and finish them off with a second alpha attack or medium sized beaters in the air. \r\n\r\n#### The OTK is Secret Legion + Courageous Soul EOT --&gt; Deadly Raid on your turn. This deals 36 damage with no other cards. The three card combo can kill opponents out of nowhere and forces them to deal with it or lose. \r\n\r\n### Card Choices\r\n\r\n**Good** \r\n\r\n[Angel of Mercy](/card/angel_of_mercy):  \r\n##### AoM lets us grind in the late game. Getting back a Gold Dragon against burn, Avenging Angels in the mirror, or just a Lord of the Arena to threaten 13 damage can be big game against different decks. Generates card advantage if left unchecked. That being said if we have too many of her too early she's just a 4/5 ambush flier that doesn't do much. \r\n\r\n[Avenging Angel](/card/avenging_angel): \r\n##### I would call Avenging Angel the mirror breaker, but I think she's good enough to go into almost any deck. She's almost the sole reason you run removal in this deck and not just token generators and anthem events. Her text box would be insane if it was just her ability to pillow fort you. \r\n\r\n[Ceasefire](/card/ceasefire): \r\n##### Ceasefire saves you from opposing go wide strategies. It feels great to take 4 from an opposing Courageous Soul and stop their other threats from attacking when you have a Deadly Raid or a Frost Giant in hand. It also draws two along with its effect. Tempo and card advantage in one useful package. \r\n\r\n[Gold Dragon](/card/gold_dragon): \r\n##### Puts games away. Keeps you out of range of burn decks even if you only get to attack in with your tokens once and lets you pull way ahead. Keeps you from dying to your opponents combo on the crack back. Life gain usually isn't that great, but it's also an evasive 6/6 with haste that eats Lightning Storms instead of your face. \r\n\r\n[Inheritance of the Meek](/card/inheritance_of_the_meek): \r\n##### This card is busted. Boardwipes are already pushed by WWG, but this card clears the way for tokens to jam in. With all of the 0 gold anthems and effects this deck plays it's usually an atack for a healthy amount. If it's dead it also draws 2. We don't want too many though or you end up play an awkward control game so I've only included 2.\r\n\r\n[Insurgency](/card/insurgency): \r\n##### 8 unbreakable power over 4 bodies at the least sounds pretty good. Add in event speed and you've got a brew going. Almost as good as Secret Legion, but not quite. That's still high praise and I don't know why you wouldn't play this in a tokens strategy. Good on offense and good on defense. Drop in these guys to block opposing tokens and anthem them on your turn for huge amounts of tempo. \r\n\r\n[Lord of the Arena](/card/lord_of_the_arena): \r\n##### 13 attack that must be blocked isn't something to scoff at. Get that opposing Thundarus out of the way for your Avenging Angel or their lone blocker for another Lord attack, or just slap them around for 13 if they have no blockers. \r\n\r\n[Palace Guard](/card/palace_guard): \r\n##### Spot removal for those pesky threats like Avenging Angel. Oozes value even when not in this shell. However it's a little slow and we have Inheritance of the Meek to take care of more than one opposing champion. But this guy turns sideways and can go face, so one it is. \r\n\r\n[Rabble Rouser](/card/rabble_rouser): \r\n##### Secret Legion EoT, ready, Rabble Rouser, expend Rouser, get a cool 12 dorks. He's even more insane with an Insurgency a turn after if he lives. He can go wider than anything else we have access to with some help and generates tons of tokens for Deadly Raid. Guy's bonkers, but by himself he isn't a huge threat. Good thing he shouldn't be alone if we're playing our game. \r\n\r\n[Secret Legion](/card/secret_legion): \r\n##### The bread and butter. I shouldn't have to explain the inclusion here. 6 1/1 blitzers. They hold anthems like champs and let us go wide on offense and defense. \r\n\r\n[Standard Bearer](/card/standard_bearer): \r\n##### Generates tokens and gives good guys +2/+0 at event speed. Not mush to say about this guy except that he's a pillar of the deck. \r\n\r\n[The People's Champion](/card/the_people_s_champion): \r\n##### Resilient 8/7 threat that can continuously generate value over a long game. Much like Angel of Mercy, but we want him turn one if we can get him. Secret Legion makes 8 guys Insurgency becomes Secret Legion with more upside. \r\n\r\n[Paros, Rebel Leader](/card/paros__rebel_leader): \r\n##### The small People's Champion. An anthem effect on a body that also generates more tokens the more we play our game sounds great. Not much else to say about him. \r\n\r\n[Courageous Soul](/card/courageous_soul): \r\n##### Secret Legion is the combo card. It's one of the huge payoff cards that we get for going wide. Event speed anthem effect means that it is really hard for our opponent to interact with the combo before it gets online. Costing 0 means we can also ready and Deadly Raid giving our tokens +4/+0 and unblockable for a one turn kill. \r\n\r\n[Faithful Pegasus](/card/faithful_pegasus): \r\n##### This is the closest we can get to a cantripping champion. 0 cost draw a card in a deck that plays a lot of events seems pretty good. Allowing our Lord of the Arena to jump over blockers is great too. \r\n\r\n[Rally the People](/card/rally_the_people): \r\n##### \"Free\" anthem with recall. Allows us to give our guys +2/+0 and make more tokens if we need it. Not the best, but definitely good enough that I've never thought of cutting it. \r\n\r\n[Watchful Gargoyle](/card/watchful_gargoyle): \r\n##### Event speed cantrip. Not much else to say. I play him to make the deck smaller so we can draw to gas and this guy enables that.\r\n\r\n**Sage**\r\n\r\n[Deadly Raid](/card/deadly_raid): \r\n##### Kills em dead real fast. This card enables turn 1 kills with Courageous Soul. On their first turn Secret Legion with Courageous Soul Eot, ready, and then Deadly Raid for 36 damage if they can't deal with the combo. \r\n\r\n[Frost Giant](/card/frost_giant): \r\n##### Deadly Raid #4 with out the buff. Also can break board stalls later in the game. Ok not great. Only want the one.\r\n\r\n[Muse](/card/muse): \r\n##### Card advantage that lets us hang with control and grindy decks. Would have 3 if I could find 6 1 cost Sage cards with out sacrificing other cards in the deck, but I found slots for 2 and I think that's the right amount for now. \r\n\r\n**Evil**\r\n\r\n[Dark Leader](/card/dark_leader): \r\n##### Another anthem effect and token generator. Before Tyrants he was great and worth more of an evil investment, but Tyrants added more Good cards that we can play so he's fallen a little out of favor with me recently. \r\n\r\n[Drinker of Blood](/card/drinker_of_blood): \r\n##### Breaking board wipe insurance. Makes attacking into bigger blockers profitable for our tokens and discourages our opponent from wiping our board with break effects. \r\n\r\n[Word of Summoning](/card/word_of_summoning): \r\n##### Used to play 3 of these until the new good cards from Tyrants became legal. More event speed cantripping with an upside. There's not really an upside as demon tokens are pretty trivial, but it still pairs well with Deadly Raid etc. so I fit as many as I could into the list. \r\n\r\n**Wild**\r\n\r\n[Lightning Storm](/card/lightning_storm): \r\n##### Kills opposing Secret Legions, gives us inevitability. One of the best cards in Epic. Not much I need to explain with this one.",

I added the Evil exclusively to get access to the [Guilt Demon](/card/guilt_demon)s, and the [Plague](/card/plague)s and [The Gudgeon](/card/the_gudgeon) weren't worth it. I also had no way to deal with [Muse](/card/muse) which was a massive problem. \r\n\r\n[Smash and Burn](/card/smash_and_burn) has been great and [Lightning Storm](/card/lightning_storm) is solid.\r\n\r\n[Avenging Angel](/card/avenging_angel)s are a new addition, not sure how I feel about them.\r\n\r\n[Mist Guide Herald](/card/mist_guide_herald) is incredible because it helps get you to your threats like [White Knight](/card/white_knight) or [Triceratops](/card/triceratops), but it is also great for pulling your [Angel of Light](/card/angel_of_light)s against Burn decks.",

The deck utilizes the demon spawing engine created from [Soul Hunter](/card/soul_hunter) and [Reaper](/card/reaper). Additionally, [Dark Offering](/card/dark_offering) can be used with Soul Hunter to break opposing champions (in conjunction with [Blind Faith](/card/blind_faith) to deal with Unbreakable or Untargetable champions.\r\n\r\nSeveral Good cards have been added due to their status as staples in token decks (*cough*[Inheritance of the Meek](/card/inheritance_of_the_meek)*cough*), and the Sage cards for additional removal and value.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at building a deck in Epic, so I'm well aware that this deck probably isn't up to par with regular players. Additonally, I am the only person I know with a copy of Epic, so I don't have anyone to play constructed with or test my decks against.",

If they spend their gold on my turn to prevent that chipping, I burst them down with blitz champions ([Djinn of the Sands](/card/djinn_of_the_sands), [Rampaging Wurm](/card/rampaging_wurm)).\r\n\r\n[Army of the Apocalypse](/card/army_of_the_apocalypse) is a potential finisher, but it also works great to return [Crystal Golem](/card/crystal_golem) and/or [Winter Fairy](/card/winter_fairy). It is especially nice after [Amnesia](/card/amnesia).\r\n\r\n[Memory Spirit](/card/memory_spirit) is also great at returning my variety of 0-cost events or even [Drain Essence](/card/drain_essence)/[Flame Strike](/card/flame_strike).\r\n\r\nFor more information you can check out my blog post on it [here](http://www.tomsepicgaming.com/constructed-epic-4-color-army/).",

I havn't played it yet but from the 30 card version I made it should play fairly well with a few combos that I put in it. My favorit being [Amnesia](/card/amnesia) with [Army of the Apocalypse](/card/army_of_the_apocalypse). As in the later game it can destroy the battle feild. There may be more combos in it that I do not see but it is my first try making a deck like this. so feel free to comment suggestions but remember this deck is made not to stack cards, only one copy per deck in this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is optional if you have the card and not playing in tournaments\r\n         V\r\nReplace [Wolf Companion](/card/wolf_companion)with keira, wolf caller",

        "description_md": "The idea of the deck is to play huge **Blitz** champions and give them **Breakthrough** as evasion to get damage in. [Knight of Elara](/card/knight_of_elara) helps the cause by attacking with a group of **Breakthrough** champions to force the opponent to block with more champions to stop huge amounts of damage getting by.\r\n\r\nThis prototype version of the deck is simply a mash-up of the best **Breakthrough** and **Blitz** champions I could find along with a few supporting events. As such, it will be slow to play. I'm considering throwing in cards like [Raging T-Rex](/card/raging_t_rex) (which can be given **Breakthrough** via Events) and [Erase](/card/erase) to allow for more draw, threat, and removal. I just don't know what to cut.\r\n\r\nSuggestions will be greatly appreciated.",

[Gold Dragon](/card/gold_dragon) throws Righteous into the mix for heavy life-gain and should LotA ever find its way into the discard pile, [Angel of Mercy](/card/angel_of_mercy) is there to bring him back from the dead. [Priest of Kalnor](/card/priest_of_kalnor) and [Angelic Protector](/card/angelic_protector) defend LotA from off-turn spot removal.\r\n\r\nMost everything else in the deck exists as a means of dealing with metagame threats like [Thought Plucker](/card/thought_plucker) and [Sea Titan](/card/sea_titan).\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate feedback and suggestions to improve the deck and my skills as a deckbuilder.",

You can experiment with the Good Splash, but some decks struggle with Avenging Angel and it's a \"good\" on turn play which can't be punished by Thought Plucker.\r\n\r\nBesides Avenging Angel you have great openers like T-Rex and Triceratops. Lash and Rage let you push damage with your big creatures and with the burn spells/ creatures can often finish the game very quickly. This list might not be as aggressive as other lists, but it nearly never runs out of steam.\r\n\r\nInstead of Jungle Queen you can also run Pyromancer in that slot, both have their specific roles where they really shine.\r\n\r\nAnother note is that Final Task has exceeded my expectations. It's awesome with T-Rex and Kong and still great with Triceratops or basically any big creature you can put a Rage or Lash on.",

Uprising cards not included as I don't currently own the set.\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by Tim of old and heavily influenced by Tom's Avenging Angel Control deck. At it's core there is [Blue Dragon](/card/blue_dragon), [Helion, the Dominator](/card/helion__the_dominator), [Forcemage Apprentice](/card/forcemage_apprentice), and [Shadow Imp](/card/shadow_imp) for small pings that, in theory, can add up to significant damage if the ally abilities can be triggered multiple times.\r\n\r\nDiscard and banish are the gambits for trying to control things. [Thought Plucker](/card/thought_plucker) and [Psionic Assault](/card/psionic_assault) offer irritating discards. [Knight of Shadows](/card/knight_of_shadows) offers the same but also packs a big punch.\r\n\r\nWith good there is [Angel of Light](/card/angel_of_light) and [Second Wind](/card/second_wind) for some lifegain. [Markus, Watch Captain](/card/markus__watch_captain) was added to help deal with tokens.\r\n\r\nI chose [Resurrection](/card/resurrection) because it can put important pingers back into play if needed.\r\n\r\n[Arcane Research](/card/arcane_research) probably belongs somewhere in this deck but it has been left out because I own one physical constructed set and it is in my son's deck.

Mostly the win goes something like this Raptors for 8, one key breakthrough for 6+, and after a Flash Fire take your pick of Flame Strike, Lightning Strike and/or Strafing Dragon for the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe transform effect is indirect discard control and negates Final Task and other recursion.   It offers off turn play that cancels out the unbanishable and unbreakable trait.  Amnesia is in as one last recurrsion counter.  \r\n\r\nEight zero cost answers to Thought Plucker as well as several off turn gold plays.  \r\n\r\nPlay zero cost champions and pass.  Notice the zero cost champions have greater than two health so they are not Flash Fire fodder.  \r\n\r\nLash over [Rage](/card/rage) because it can also be used on Thought Plucker.  \r\n\r\nAngels are for the mirror match and may help a bit vs a dedicated flyer deck.\r\n\r\nWolfs Call is on the bubble, consider replacing with a Pyromancer.  While I mainly use [Hasty Retreat](/card/hasty_retreat) to draw two the zero cost fringe use case is not negligible.  \r\n\r\nFinal notes, the Raptors and Avenging Angel are decent off turn gold punishment.  Just about every card offers value when played so opponent bounce effects are not painful.",
